@TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@ \- quick binary diff

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@
.RB [ " old_file new_file diff_file " ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Computes the difference between two binary files and writes it to a binary
file suitable for use with
.B qbpatch.
.B @TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@
is an improved and modernised version of
.B bsdiff
by Colin Percival.
.B @TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@
is generally faster and can take advantage of multiple CPU cores.

The command-line invocation is deliberately the same as of
.B bsdiff
.PP

.SH PATCH COMPRESSION
.B @TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@
uses the
.B lzma
compression algorithm to compress the patch file.
.B lzma
takes considerably more time to compress data in exchange for
a good compression ratio and fast decompression. The compression ratio
is usually better than this of
.B bzip2
on binary data, and since
.B lzma
is highly assymmetric, it's also two to six times faster in decompression
(and thus patch application).

.SH MEMORY MANAGEMENT
The
.B bsdiff
memory usage is max(17*n,9*n+m)+O(1), while
.B @TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@
memory usage is usually bounded by O(5*n+m)+O(1) in most use cases - the
improvement is clear and almost twofold-threefold.

.SH INTEGRITY CHECKING
.B @TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@
will compute the BLAKE2b checksum of
.B new_file
and embed it into the patch file. The checksum is verified when
.B qbpatch
finishes patching the file.

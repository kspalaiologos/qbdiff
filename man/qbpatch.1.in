.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qbpatch
.RB [ " old_file new_file diff_file " ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Applies the previously computed difference
.B diff_file
to

(and by extension
.B qbpatch
) is an improved and modernised version of
.B bsdiff
by Colin Percival.

The command-line invocation is deliberately the same as of
.B bspatch
.PP

.SH INTEGRITY CHECKING
The integrity of the newly created file is checked by
.B qbpatch
using the BLAKE2b checksum embedded in the patch file. If the checksum
does not match, an error is reported.
